I got assigned a new case today. Case number 432971.
AKA the biggest cold case we have. 
I’ve had a good run with my past few cases, but I didn’t know the brass would place this much confidence in me. This case is important. More important than any I’ve ever gotten before. It’s also shrouded in mystery. It concerns various crimes that at first glance seem completely unrelated, but as you dig deeper, you start to realize that there’s a thread that connects them all - a massive criminal network the likes of which the world has never seen before. An organization dismissed as an urban legend by most. 
It’s called DOLUS.
