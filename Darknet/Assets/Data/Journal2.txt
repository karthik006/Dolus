I’d only heard of DOLUS in hushed voices before being assigned their case. I was fairly certain that most of what I heard was mere speculation. After all, most people have a propensity to exaggerate – it makes for a better story. Maybe that’s a cynical outlook, but that’s what I’ve seen in my line of work.
I was wrong. Arms, drugs, murder - these guys have their hands in everything. They’ve funded wars, toppled governments, and killed countless people. They are always ten steps ahead of the
law, and every cop, spy and government agent who’s gone up against them, knowingly or otherwise, has wound up either dead or missing. Five people from the Agency have handled this case before me. All five have gone AWOL. Their work – spanning the course of 10 years – is what will help me now. Maybe, between
the 6 of us, we can finally take DOLUS down.
